Bloqhouse applies **blockchain** technology to real asset investment funds. For the pilot a closed-end real estate investment fund will be tokenized.
We partner with key players in the Ethereum ecosystem to rely on state-of-the-art secure technology.
Our partnership with DLA Piper, a global law firm, ensures we cover regulatory compliance. A regulated investment fund manager will be responsible for 'off-chain' management of the tokenized fund.

.. note:: This is a work *in progress* and subject to changes.
