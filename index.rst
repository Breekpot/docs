The goal of NotaryNodes is to make **blockchain** technology a better fit to **real assets** that are under **legal jurisdiction** i.e. that are regulated.

Blockchain technology for real - regulated - assets
---------------------------------------------------

Smart contract technology makes digitizing assets rather straightforward.
Though bringing it to production-ready real world use cases is *not* straightforward.
NotaryNodes aims to **close the gap** between **code and law**.

NotaryNodes is an **open initiative**, knowledge and code will be made available **open source**.
Contributions are welcome, please request access on Github.

.. note:: This is a work *in progress*. Documentation, legal framework and code all have incubation status. Insights & solutions are subject to constant change!

The documentation for the site is organized into a couple sections:

* :ref:`docs-notarynodes`
* :ref:`docs-legal`
* :ref:`docs-bloqs`
