.. note:: This is a work in progress. Please read the section about the Bloqtoken first, :ref:`bloqintro`.

This section illustrates some example services built on top of the BloqToken ecosystem.

Bloqhouse Wallet Ðapp
---------------------

Bloqhouse will provide open source wallet applications that allows investors to manage their real estate portfolio and trade the tokens.
Visit `Bloqhouse.com <https://www.bloqhouse.com>`__ to apply for the pilot and buy Bloqs during the Genesis BloqTokens Issuance (scheduled for Q4 2017).
If you want to develop your own applications on top of the BloqToken ecosystem, visit the :ref:`bloqstarted` page.

Collateralized peer-to-peer lending
-----------------------------------

Among the dozens of potential applications of tokenized real estate a very promising one would be collateralized peer-to-peer loans between friends or between a bank and customer.
Bloqhouse will organize a :ref:`bloqathon` to kick-start development on top of the **open** Bloqtoken ecoystem.
