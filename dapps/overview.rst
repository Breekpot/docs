.. note:: This is a work in progress.

This section illustrates some example services built on top of the BloqToken ecosystem.

Bloqhouse Wallet app
--------------------

.. note:: Please read the section about the Bloqtoken first, :ref:`bloqintro`..

Bloqhouse is a wallet application that allows people to manage their real estate portfolio.
Visit `Bloqhouse.com <https://www.bloqhouse.com>`__ to apply for the pilot and buy Bloqs during the Genesis BloqTokens Issuance (scheduled for Q3 2017).
If you want to develop your own applications on top of the BloqToken ecosystem, visit the :ref:`bloqstarted` page.

Collateralized peer-to-peer lending
-----------------------------------

Another example application one could think of is to use Bloqs to collateralize peer-to-peer loans between friends or between a bank and customer.
Coming winter Bloqhouse plans to organize a :ref:`bloqathon` to kick-start development on top of the **open** Bloqtoken ecoystem.
